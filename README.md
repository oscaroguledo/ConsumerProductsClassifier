# ConsumerProductsClassifier
The ConsumerProductsClassifier is a machine learning model designed to classify consumer product titles into specific categories (e.g., "Clothing", "Electronics", "Cosmetics") and extract the item (e.g., "Shirt", "Headphones", "Shoe"). The model takes a product title or description as input and performs two tasks:

Category Classification: Predicts the broader category the product belongs to.
Item Extraction: Identifies and extracts the specific item name from the product title.
This model can be useful for automating product categorization, inventory management, and recommendation systems by providing structured data about products based on their descriptions.
